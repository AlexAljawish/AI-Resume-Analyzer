# AI Resume Analyzer

An **AI-powered Resume Analyzer** that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help job seekers optimize their resumes by matching them with specific job descriptions. This application extracts key skills from resumes, compares them with the job requirements, and calculates a match percentage to help candidates improve their chances.

## üöÄ Features

- **Resume Upload**: Upload your resume in PDF format for analysis.
- **Job Description Input**: Paste the job description to compare with your resume.
- **Skill Extraction**: Extracts relevant skills from your resume.
- **Match Percentage**: Displays a percentage showing how well your resume matches the job description.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides actionable suggestions to improve your resume‚Äôs match with the job.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Python** (Flask)
  - Libraries: `spaCy`, `flask`, `sklearn`
  
- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js** with TailwindCSS for styling
  - **Axios** for API requests
  
- **NLP**: Utilizes **spaCy** to extract and compare skills between the resume and the job description.

## üîß How It Works

The **AI Resume Analyzer** functions in two key steps:

1. **Skill Extraction**:
   - The system processes the uploaded resume, identifying **skills**, **qualifications**, and **experiences** (extracted as nouns and proper nouns).

2. **Matching**:
   - The job description is parsed, and key requirements and skills are extracted. The extracted resume skills are then compared with the job description to compute a **match percentage**.

Additionally, the application provides **suggestions** for improving the resume based on mismatches between the extracted skills and the job requirements.
